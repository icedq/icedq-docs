## Perform preflight checks

Preflight checks run automatically and verify that your setup meets the minimum requirements.



You can skip these checks, but we recommend you let them run.

Fix any issues in the preflight steps. A common example is the message:


```
Your cluster meets the minimum version of Kubernetes, but we recommend you update to 1.15.0 or later.
```

You can update your cluster's version of Kubernetes if you like.

## Deploy icedq

When you are finished pre-flight checks, click **Deploy and** **Continue**.


iCEDQ is deployed in a 30 minutes.

Once deployment is done, check the application deployment status, Only one service (vault) should be in pending status,
